Established in July 2022 in Vercelli (Italy), Videntes: A Multispectral Imaging Collective includes four scholars whose academic training varies from History and Literature to Art History and Digital Humanities. Our teaching and professional service includes secondary and higher education, libraries and special collections, and collaborations with international project-based teams. Our name, _Videntes_ (Latin, plural for the act of seeing), is evocative of our commitment to seeing together; to looking across disciplinary boundaries and historical chronologies, and to bringing attention to the medieval processes used to make handmade books (called manuscripts) and the modern technologies that can be applied to those books and their places of use (such as multispectral imaging or photogrammetry). By seeing together we recover things lost (or unseen) and illuminate what mattered about an object in the past, as well as argue what should matter to the present and imagine what could matter for the future. In summer 2023 Videntes will return to Vercelli to work in collaboration with Dr. Silvia Faccin, segratario and conservator of manuscripts for the Museo del Tesoro del Duomo e Archivio Capitolare. Our work will include consulting archival materials and manuscripts related to seven carta (sheets of parchment) once used as part of the medieval curriculum in Vercelli’s Cathedral School. Videntes is also in the preliminary planning stages for research and imaging trips to Palermo, Paris, and Vienna to see object related to the Vercelli carta.
