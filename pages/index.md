Evan A. Gatti, professor, specializes in medieval art with a focus on 11th-century art commissioned by bishops in connection and conflict with the Ottonian and Salian Empires. Gatti was the co-editor for Envisioning the Bishop: Images and the Episcopacy in the Middle Ages with Sigrid Danielson (Brepols 2014). Gatti and Danielson also co-authored a bibliography on Art in Italy for Oxford Bibliographies Online - Medieval Studies (2012), which is also currently under revision. Gatti has a co-authored book chapter (with Eliza Garrison) on the Quedlinburg Casket in press (Brill Publishers, 2022) as well as an article in press on the portraits of Sigebert of Minden for Gesta. Gatti is currently at work on a project concerned with concepts of facsimile and historiography with a focus on the rotulus featuring scenes from the Acts of the Apostles held in the Archivio Capitolare in Vercelli. Gatti is a founding member and former president of EPISCOPUS: The Society for the Study of Bishops & the Secular Clergy in the Middle Ages and works closely with the Power of the Bishop Conference and is co-editing their recent conference proceedings.

At Elon, Gatti is the coordinator for Elon's Art History program and a new minor in Museum Studies and Public History. Gatti served as the Associate Director of the Elon Core Curriculum from 2014-2019. In 2009, Gatti received the Elon College Excellence in Service/Leadership Award. In 2012, she received the Student Government Association's Gerald F. Francis Award for Outstanding Faculty Member, and in 2019, she was awarded Elon College Excellence in Mentoring Award.
