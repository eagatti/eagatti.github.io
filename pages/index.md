Evan A. Gatti specializes in medieval art with a focus on 11th-century art commissioned by bishops in connection and conflict with the Ottonian and Salian Empires. Gatti was the co-editor for Envisioning the Bishop: Images and the Episcopacy in the Middle Ages with Sigrid Danielson (Brepols 2014). Gatti and Danielson also co-authored a bibliography on Art in Italy for Oxford Bibliographies Online - Medieval Studies (2012). She co-authored book chapter (with Eliza Garrison) on the Quedlinburg Casket (Brill Publishers, 2022) and an article in Gesta on the portraits of Sigebert of Minden. Gatti is currently at work on a project concerned with concepts of facsimile and historiography with a focus on the rotulus featuring scenes from the Acts of the Apostles held in the Archivio Capitolare in Vercelli. Gatti is a founding member and former president of EPISCOPUS: The Society for the Study of Bishops & the Secular Clergy in the Middle Ages and works closely with the Power of the Bishop Conference and is co-editing their recent conference proceedings.
